CIS-Dept. Light Skin for PmWiki 2
=================================
INSTALL.txt

This skin installs in two easy steps:
0) Make sure you are using PmWiki 2.0.beta44 or newer.
1) Put the files in the correct location.
2) Configure PmWiki to use the skin with some lines in the
   local configuration file.


Step 1 - Copy files.
--------------------
Copy the light/ directory to your wiki's pub/skins/ directory.
The directory contains the following files:

pub/skins/light/
|-- README.txt                Brief documentation
|-- INSTALL.txt               This file
|-- light.tmpl                Template
|-- light.php                 PHP script
|-- light.css                 CSS stylesheet
|-- light2.css                CSS stylesheet 2
|-- lighticon.gif             Icon image
|-- lightlogo.gif             Logo graphic image
|-- lightlogo-old.gif         Old logo graphic image
|-- lightlogo2.gif            Alternate logo graphic image
|-- lightviews.php            "View" switching script
|-- print/
|   `-- print.tmpl            Print View template
`-- wikilib.d/
    |-- Main.AboutThisSite         Default About This Site page
    |-- Main.AllRecentChanges      Non-$SiteGroup AllRecentChanges page
    |-- Site.LightEditForm         Custom Edit Form
    |-- Site.LightXLPage           Preferences Page
    |-- Site.Search                Custom Search page
    `-- Site.UploadQuickReference  Custuom UploadQuickReference page


Step 2 - Edit local configuration file.
---------------------------------------
The following lines go in your local/config.php local configuration
file.

## Use the CIS-Dept. Light Skin and its printable-view skin.
SDV($Skin, 'light');
SDV($ActionSkin['print'], 'light/print');
## Enable the Light Skin's Content Management-oriented features.
# $EnableCMSMode = 1;

If you don't have a local/config.php yet you'll need to create one.
Make sure that "<?php" is the very first line, with no leading spaces.
You don't need a closing "?>". Here's an example local/config.php:

<?php
## Title of this wiki
$WikiTitle = 'My Site';

## Use the CIS-Dept. Light Skin and its printable view skin.
SDV($Skin, 'light');
SDV($ActionSkin['print'], 'light/print');
## Enable the Light Skin's Content Management-oriented features.
$EnableCMSMode = 1;

## Set an administrative password.
$DefaultPasswords['admin'] = '$1$xNI5oUI9$vQtoUEMmyYUfYGWX3msvJ/';

## Require authors to provide an Author Name 
$EnablePostAuthorRequired = 1;

## Keep read-protected pages from appearing in search results.
$EnablePageListProtect = 1;

## Require approval of links to external sites.
include_once('scripts/urlapprove.php');
$UnapprovedLinkCountMax = 10;

## Enable RSS and Atom feeds web feeds.
if ($action == 'rss' || $action == 'atom') {
  include_once("scripts/feeds.php"); }

## Enable ?action=refcount for finding missing and orphaned pages.
if ($action == 'refcount') {
  $HandleAuth['refcount'] = 'edit';
  include_once('scripts/refcount.php'); }

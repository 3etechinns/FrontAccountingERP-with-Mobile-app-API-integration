Package: rep_tax_cash_basis
Name: Tax inquiry and detailed report on cash basis
Description: It reports payments and receipts that include a tax component when the transaction was recorded in the bank account, rather than when the sale or purchase was invoiced. For New Zealand the default reporting is on a gross basis, rather than net so the inquiry screen and detail report have the option of reporting on a gross (before tax is deducted), or net (after tax is deducted) and defaults to gross basis.
